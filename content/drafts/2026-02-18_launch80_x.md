Launching your startup shouldn't feel like solo reconnaissance.

Most founders I know spend months:

- Learning everything from scratch
- Staring at blank docs with no direction
- Worrying they're missing something critical

Launch80 exists to change that.

We've built a path — not just a portal. The DIY startup toolkit means you're not flying blind. The Discord community means you're never truly alone.

Want validation before you dive in?

- Read our guide on starting lean
- Join the Discord to ask questions
- Browse our portal for framework templates

We know what works because we've seen hundreds of founders succeed and fail. Let us shorten your learning curve.
