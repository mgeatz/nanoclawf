The myth of the "perfect founder."

Common story: You have the vision, the execution, and the market clarity — all before you ever talk to a customer.

Total fiction.

Real founders learn:

- Your initial idea needs 3-5 iterations to hit the market right
- Customer feedback will reshape everything — and that's good
- Speed trumps perfection every time

Launch80 helps you move from "idea in your head" to "business in motion." Here's how:

1️⃣ Start with what you already understand
2️⃣ Build a minimal MVP, then validate
3️⃣ Iterate based on real data, not assumptions
4️⃣ Seek community early — it's cheaper than failing alone

The best time to build your startup was months ago. The second-best time is right now.
